# Ghostmode
Simple utility to make a player immortal, have infinite jetpack fuel and invisible to other players in Stationeers
Made for Largely Unemployed's mod bounty

# Usage
When in-game as the host player, Press **F3** to open the in-game console and type `ghost <playerId>` where `playerId` is printed into the console on player join (Steam IDs will work 90% of the time). Run the command again to disable the ghost status
