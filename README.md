# Ghostmode
Simple utility to make a player immortal, have infinite jetpack fuel and invisible to other players in Stationeers
Made for Largely Unemployed's mod bounty

# Usage
When in-game as the host player, Press **F3** to open the in-game console and type `ghost <playerId>` where `playerId` is printed into the console on player join (Steam IDs will work 90% of the time). Run the command again to disable the ghost status

# Installation
Download and install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/) to the game directory, launch the game once and put the .dll file from [releases](https://github.com/wojtmic/stationeers-ghostmode/releases/tag/1.0.0) into `<gameDirectory>/BepInEx/plugins/`.
